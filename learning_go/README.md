# Learning go

Go converts the source code into native machine language. The quickest way of
compiling and running your code is with the `run` subcommand and `build` to
compile and save your program:

```bash
go run 001_hello_world.go
こんにちは

go build 001_hello_world.go
./001_hello_world
こんにちは
```

Go code is organized in packages (files in directories) and comes with an
extensive standard library full of packages.
